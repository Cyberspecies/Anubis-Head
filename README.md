## Features
* Movable Jaw
* Single colour printer compatible
* No foam required to wear
* Light construction

## Hardware
All parts are printed seperately which includes all of the gold parts and will snap together. The main symbol on the head however wont snap, and you'll have to either glue or weld it, however it allows the head to remain very thin and comfortable to wear. The eye mesh should be printed around 60% rectilinear infill with 12 walls at 0.2mm layer height for the same density I have in the photos. Then the mesh is spot welded into the mask by simply pressing something hot to spot weld along the edge of the mesh that is 12 walls. Normal rubber bands are placed and folder 4 times around the ridges on the jaw joint.

#### Files
All files are available on [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1464114-anubis-mask) but is also provided here under [hardware](/Hardware/README.md).

## Roadmap
* Milestones: Fully printable single colour per print version
* Milestones: Small build volume split stl version
* Milestones: Full colour version (no assembly)
